# INTRODUCTION
====================

The theme of the web app is a chart that displays the top 10 shows on Apple Podcast, Spotify, and Stitcher.

This is a simple web app created to understand HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the basics of three-tier architecture in web development. At the time of the project (May 2022), I have not learned how to integrate databases or how to deploy the app. As a result, all content is static and runs on localhost port 8000.


# REQUIREMENTS
====================

* node
* express


# INSTALLATION
====================

Clone the project, install node and relevant packages, and run.

# CONFIGURATION
====================

Change port if needed.
